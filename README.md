# Shortcuts
Welcome to my Shortcuts repository! This repository represents a comprehensive list and details of all Apple shortcuts I've developed till date. 

To download my shortcuts, click on any of the shortcuts down below and click on the banner within each file. You can also find my shortcuts published on [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/user/MrJeevs).
